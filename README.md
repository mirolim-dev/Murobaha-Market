## Key Features

-   **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and token-based (JWT) authentication.
-   **Product Catalog**: Browse and search for products across various categories.
-   **Shopping Cart**: A persistent cart for users to add and manage products.
-   **Installment Order System**: A unique checkout process where users can request to buy products on a timed payment plan by specifying a down payment and installment duration.
-   **Order Request Management**: Users can track the status of their order requests (`In Progress`, `Accepted`, `Denied`, `Cancelled`).
-   **Payment Schedule Tracking**: View a detailed schedule of past and upcoming installment payments for approved orders.
-   **Admin Panel**: A built-in Django admin interface for easy management of products, categories, and user order requests.

## System Architecture

The backend is built using a **Monolithic Architecture** with Django, serving a RESTful API for a mobile client (e.g., React Native, Flutter). This architecture was chosen for its simplicity in development, deployment, and maintenance for a project of this scale.

-   **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL
-   **Client**: Mobile Application (consumes this API)

## Technology Stack

-   **Framework**: Django
-   **API**: Django REST Framework (DRF)
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL
-   **Authentication**: Simple JWT (JSON Web Token) for DRF
-   **Environment Management**: `python-decouple`
-   **Image Handling**: `Pillow`

## Database Schema

The database is designed to handle the core logic of products, users, and installment orders.

 <!-- It's highly recommended to create and link a diagram of your models -->

**Core Models**:
-   `User`: Extends Django's `AbstractUser` for profile information.
-   `Category`: For organizing products (e.g., "Clothing", "Electronics").
-   `Product`: Contains product details like name, price, and description.
-   `Cart` & `CartItem`: Manages the user's shopping cart.
-   `OrderRequest`: The central model that stores a user's request to purchase items on an installment plan.
-   `OrderRequestItem`: Links products to an `OrderRequest`.
-   `PaymentSchedule`: Automatically generated when an `OrderRequest` is approved, tracking each installment's due date, amount, and status.

## API Endpoints

A detailed list of API endpoints is available through our Swagger/OpenAPI documentation. Once the server is running, you can access it at:
-   **Swagger UI**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs/`
-   **ReDoc**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/redoc/`

*For a detailed breakdown of all available routes, please refer to the documentation above.*

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   PostgreSQL
-   `git`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/murobaha-market.git
    cd murobaha-market
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    ```
    *On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`*

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root. Copy the contents of `.env.example` and fill in your configuration details (database credentials, secret key, etc.).
    ```ini
    # .env
    SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
    DEBUG=True
    DATABASE_URL='postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/NAME'
    ```

5.  **Set up the database:**
    Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables.
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Create a superuser:**
    This will allow you to access the Django admin panel.
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

2.  **Access the Admin Panel:**
    Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and log in with the superuser credentials you created.
